I just started using Alfred, which has seriously changed my life.  I stumbled across [Joel Califa's emoji snippet pack](http://joelcalifa.com/blog/alfred-emoji-snippet-pack/), which absolutely rules, but I found that I wanted to convert all of the 👍s to the emoji with the Fitzpatrick modifier that I use.

This script generates new json files with this change from Joel's work.  The result includes five directories, one for each modifier.
