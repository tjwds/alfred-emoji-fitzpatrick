# Alfred Emoji Fitzpatrick

(this README is a work in progress, like the rest of the project!)

I just started using Alfred, which has seriously changed my life.  I stumbled across [Joel Califa's emoji snippet pack](http://joelcalifa.com/blog/alfred-emoji-snippet-pack/), which absolutely rules, but I found that I wanted to convert all of the 👍s to the emoji with the Fitzpatrick modifier that I use.

So this script, in its current form, generates new json files with this change from Joel's work.  The result includes five directories, one for each modifier.

(for now, rename Joel's `EmojiPack.alfredsnippets` to a zip file and unpack it into `vendor/json` for this to work. You'll also need to run this: `mkdir dist && cd dist && mkdir dark light medium medium-dark medium-light && cd ..`.)
